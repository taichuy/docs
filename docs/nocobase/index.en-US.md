# NocoBase Plugins by taichuy Team

---

During our taichuy team's extensive use of NocoBase for developing internal systems, we have accumulated a series of practical plugins.

Adhering to the open-source spirit, we share some simple and practical plugins for free. Meanwhile, to balance R&D costs, we charge for some plugins that are complex and require significant development investment, to support continuous development.
